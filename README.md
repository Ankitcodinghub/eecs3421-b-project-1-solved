In this project, you are to develop an entity-relationship schema / diagram for the Canadian International Photography Award domain described below. Draw an E/R diagram, clearly identifying the

<ul>
<li>entity sets,</li>
<li>relationship sets,</li>
<li>multiplicity (e.g., many-one’s &amp; many-many’s),</li>
<li>attributes,</li>
<li>keys, and</li>
<li>additional constraints
In this project, we use the notations and diagramming rules — the Stanford dialect of E/R — as described in the textbook and in class.

E/R Dialects (Warning!)

The textbook and our examples in the lectures use the Stanford style of E/R modelling. Note that there are many dialects of E/R, however. For consistency, for this project, you must adhere to the Stanford (the textbook’s) dialect.

This design exercise is meant to simulate a real life system-analysis situation; hence, the domain description above is unstructured, and sometimes fuzzy. It is your responsibility as an analyst / designer to translate what you read into a proper E/R diagram that models the domain correctly.

Keep the following things in mind for your design.

<ol>
<li>In real life, many more data elements than described in the “requirements” above would be needed to build a useful database. We do not, however, want to turn this project into something huge. So keep in mind that this is a highly simplified case.</li>
<li>As a general approach, if a particular constraint is not explicitly given, then assume the least restricted situation. For example, “many” in the E/R Model is less restricted than “at most one”.</li>
<li>You are not required to specify the domains of the attributes here in your diagram.</li>
<li>Make certain that you clearly indicate any constraints in your design that are additional to
those captured in the logic of your E/R diagram.

That is, state any constraints that are indicated by the requirements, but that you know are not enforced by your design in brief documentation attached with your design. For each such case, explain whether the unenforced constraint is
</li>
</ol>
o beyond the scope of E/R,

o seems to be beyond the scope (but you do not know for certain), o would greatly complicate the design beyond value, or

o is simply not accommodated in your design.

Deliverable

Submit an electronic copy in PDF of your project. (Note that submission of anything but PDF will be rejected!)

You also need to hand in a printed version of your project. Online Submission Due: by 11:59pm Thursday 3 October 2019. In Class Submission Due: 10:00am Friday 4 October 2019. Your PDF document should include the following.

<ul>
<li>Cover Page

A cover page should have your name and student#, and should indicate it is for the E/R Project of EECS-3421B for Fall 2019.</li>
<li>E/R Schema

Your full E/R diagram for the CIPA database.</li>
<li>Documentation

Paragraphs explaining details about the design.

o Any clarifications about your E/R diagram that are not evident in the model itself. o Any assumptions that you had to make with respect to the requirements. (In the real world, these would then be resolved in a follow-up requirements meeting.)

o Any constraints (business rules) apparent from the requirements that you are unable to model via your E/R schema.

The documentation may be minimal — or even absent — if your model has no such needed clarifications.

Your project must be typeset; that is, no hand-drawn diagrams. The cover page for submitting your work should look something as follows.

Matching Requirements

We suggest working on your design iteratively, little by little. E/R is a refinement process. Get a rough sketch of your design first. Then improve on it to fix issues as you find them.

Diagramming Software

There are a number of professional tools companies use for E/R, but many are rather expensive and specialized. They often provide lots of additional functionality, such as verifiers and automated tools to help translate to relational.

Many generic drawing packages that include diagram / semantic support work nicely, however. Some suitable applications good for drawing E/R are

<ul>
<li>LibreOffice (its Draw facility) of The Document Foundation,</li>
<li>The Dia Diagram Editor,</li>
<li>Microsoft Visio, and</li>
<li>OmniGraffle (The Omni Group),
Visio and OmniGraffle are great, but somewhat expensive proprietary drawing and generic diagramming applications. Dia is not bad, and is free and open source software under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2), which we used to use. We recommend LibreOffice, which is excellent free and open source software under the Mozilla Public License (MPLv2.0).

Some of the diagramming packages may be missing one or two things kind of needed for E/R. For example, there seems to no easy way to underline text in Dia, but key attributes should be underlined. In this case, you could use bold for key attributes (and partial key attributes in week entities), instead. Just make note in your E/R design document any such notational changes that you make due to drawing-application limitations. Pick some reasonable, obvious convention for your arrowheads, following the textbook’s style, the class’s lecture style, or something that is obvious and similar.
